This is the first in a series of projects written in source ports of [id tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech)(or just using the engine source code). 

The drive for this project came from the frustration of how big/bloated engines like Unreal and Unity have become, and a desire to work with a simpler set of tools. The secondary goal was to explore making a game/experience about the mundane or the everyday, and finally to use an art style which used real world photos from my life and my surroundings. 

## Tigerbun - The Doom Mod
This is not really a game, more of a experience. There are no goals, other than to give into the demands of an older ginger cat called Tigerbun. These demands include pets, food, naps and treats, this is all done in a short compressed time frame so that the core 'mechanics' don't go stale.
